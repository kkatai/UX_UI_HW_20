        <p class="card-text">I went through a LOT of rounds of iterations on the original 'Priority Tab' naming, eventually settling on just naming it what was inside: 'Bureaus, Offices, & Services'. It was probably the biggest pain point for users on understanding what was there. It made more sense to expand the title instead of adding 3 tabs to the navigation system for simplicity. Overall, I wanted the site to feel updated and earth, while not being too modern, as to be accessible for users of all ages.  </p>

        <p class="conclusionText">In future, I'd love to expand upon more pages instead of just Tribal Nations, but in the beginning I felt it was one of the most confusing pages to navigate through, which is why I chose to iterate on it. I chose to stick with the one flow to keep my scope tight for the time I had to complete the project. I found that laying out the navigation/basics first makes it easier for everything else to fall into place in the layout, but because people were having problems clicking through the site to begin with, I made the navigation system my top priority in redesigning. While I like the chosen color scheme, I do feel like the site is a bit bright, and would probably go back and iterate on some of the shades to keep them warm but a little more toned down, or maybe switch out the hero image. I'd also make the hero scrollable or add actual content to more of the interior pages instead of having a generic "catchall" page that I kept for time's sake.</p>
